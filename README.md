# Olympic-Exploration

Notebook for fun, exploring the dataset "120 years of olympic history: athletes and results" -
see more information (on Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results].

## Motivation

I started this project mainly to apply skills I've learned in university courses to something interesting outside of school. 

## Current status

The notebook is very much still a work in progress, and I'll be making updates daily.
